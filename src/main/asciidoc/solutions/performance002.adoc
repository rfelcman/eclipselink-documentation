== Monitoring and Optimizing EclipseLink-Enabled Applications

The most important challenge to performance tuning is knowing what to
optimize. To improve the performance of your application, identify the
areas of your application that do not operate at peak efficiency. This
section contains information about these subjects:

=== Performance Optimization Recommendations and Tips

EclipseLink provides a diverse set of features to measure and optimize
application performance. You can enable or disable most features in the
descriptors or session, making any resulting performance gains
global.Performance considerations are present at every step of the
development cycle. Although this implies an awareness of performance
issues in your design and implementation, it does not mean that you
should expect to achieve the best possible performance in your first
pass.

For example, if optimization complicates the design, leave it until the
final development phase. You should still plan for these optimizations
from your first iteration, to make them easier to integrate later.

The most important concept associated with tuning your EclipseLink
application is the idea of an iterative approach. The most effective way
to tune your application is to do the following tasks:

* link:#CHDIAFJI[Task 1: Measure EclipseLink Performance with the
EclipseLink Profiler].
* link:#CIAFFAIF[Task 2: Measure EclipseLink Performance in the Server
Environment]
* link:#CIAFGJHI[Task 3: Measure Fetch Group Field Usage]
* link:#CHDICBBA[Task 4: Identify Sources of Application Performance
Problems].
* link:#CHDDCABJ[Task 5: Modify Poorly-Performing Application
Components].
* link:#CHDHGFDI[Task 6: Measure Performance Again].

=== Task 1: Measure EclipseLink Performance with the EclipseLink Profiler

The EclipseLink performance profiler helps you identify performance
problems by logging performance statistics for every executed query in a
given session. Use the performance profiler to monitor a single query,
or simple single-threaded use case.

The EclipseLink performance profiler logs the following information to
the log file.

==== Enabling the EclipseLink Profiler

The EclipseLink performance profiler is an instance of
`org.eclipse.persistence.tools.profiler.PerformanceProfiler` class. To
enable it, add the following line to the `persistence.xml` file:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<property name="eclipselink.profiler" value="PerformanceProfiler.logProfiler"/>
----

In addition to enabling the EclipseLink profiler, The
`PerformanceProfiler` class public API also provides the functionality
described in link:#CHDGBGGC[Table 18-2]:

[#TLADG443]####[#sthref148]####[#CHDGBGGC]##

[#TLADG444]##

[#sthref149]##

==== Accessing and Interpreting Profiler Results

You can see profiling results by opening the profile log in a text
reader, such as Notepad.

The profiler output file indicates the health of a EclipseLink-enabled
application.

link:#CHDBGFGG[Example 18-7] shows an sample of the EclipseLink profiler
output.

[#CHDBGFGG]####[#TLADG445]####

*_Example 18-7 Performance Profiler Output_*

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
Begin Profile of{
ReadAllQuery(com.demos.employee.domain.Employee)
Profile(ReadAllQuery,# of obj=12, time=139923809,sql execute=21723809,
prepare=49523809, row fetch=39023809, time/obj=11623809,obj/sec=8)
} End Profile
----

link:#CHDBGFGG[Example 18-7] shows the following information about the
query:

* `ReadAllQuery(com.demos.employee.domain.Employee)`: specific query
profiled, and its arguments.
* `Profile(ReadAllQuery`: start of the profile and the type of query.
* `# of obj=12`: number of objects involved in the query.
* `time=139923809`: total execution time of the query (in milliseconds).
* `sql execute=21723809`: total time spent executing the SQL statement.
* `prepare=49523809`: total time spent preparing the SQL statement.
* `row fetch=39023809`: total time spent fetching rows from the
database.
* `time/obj=116123809`: number of nanoseconds spent on each object.
* `obj/sec=8`: number of objects handled per second.

[#CIAFFAIF]####[#TLADG1230]####

=== Task 2: Measure EclipseLink Performance in the Server Environment

Use the Performance Monitor to provide detailed profiling and monitoring
information in a multithreaded server environment. Use the performance
monitor to monitor a server, multiple threads, or long running
processes.

Enable the monitor in `persistence.xml` file as follows:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<property name="eclipselink.profiler" value="PerformanceMonitor"/>
----

The performance monitor can also be enabled through code using a
`SessionCustomizer`.

The performance monitor will output a dump of cumulative statistics
every minute to the EclipseLink log. The statistics contains three sets
of information:

* *Info*; statistics that are constant informational data, such as the
session name, or time of login.
* *Counter*; statistics that are cumulative counters of total
operations, such as cache hits, or query executions.
* *Timer*; statistics that are cumulative measurements of total time (in
nano seconds) for a specific type of operation, reading, writing,
database operations.

Statistics are generally grouped in total and also by query type, query
class, and query name. Counters and timers are generally recorded for
the same operations, so the time per operation could also be calculated.

The time between statistic dumps can be configured by using the
`setDumpTime(long)` method in the `PerformanceMonitor` class. If dumping
the results is not desired, then the `dumpTime` attribute can be set to
be very large such as `Long.MAX_VALUE`. The statistic can also be
accessed in a Java program with the `getOperationTime(String)` method.

The performance monitor can also be configured with a profile weight.
The profile weights are defined in the `SessionProfiler` class and used
by the PerformanceMonitor class. The weights include:

* `NONE`—No statistics are recorded.
* `NORMAL`—Informational statistics are recorded.
* `HEAVY`—Informational, counter and timer statistics are recorded.
* `ALL`—All statistics are recorded (this is the default).

In the current release, the performance monitor responds with the same
information for the `HEAVY` and `ALL` values.

[#CIAFGJHI]####[#TLADG1231]####

=== Task 3: Measure Fetch Group Field Usage

Use the Fetch Group Monitor to measure fetch group field usage. This can
be useful for performance analysis in a complex system.

Enable this monitor by using the system property
`org.eclipse.persistence.fetchgroupmonitor=true`.

The monitor outputs the attribute used for a class every time a new
attribute is accessed.

[#CHDICBBA]####[#TLADG446]####

=== Task 4: Identify Sources of Application Performance Problems

Areas of the application where performance problems could occur include
the following:

* Identifying General Performance Optimization
* Schema
* Mappings and Descriptors
* Sessions
* Cache
* Data Access
* Queries
* Unit of Work
* Application Server and Database Optimization

link:#CHDDCABJ[Task 5: Modify Poorly-Performing Application Components]
provides some guidelines for dealing with problems in each of these
areas.

[#CHDDCABJ]####[#TLADG447]####

=== Task 5: Modify Poorly-Performing Application Components

For each source of application performance problems listed in
link:#CHDICBBA[Task 4: Identify Sources of Application Performance
Problems], you can try specific workarounds, as described in this
section.

[#TLADG448]##

[#sthref150]##

==== Identifying General Performance Optimizations

*Avoid overriding EclipseLink default behavior unless your application
requires it*. Some of these defaults are suitable for a development
environment; you should change these defaults to suit your production
environment. These defaults may include:

* Batch writing – See "jdbc.batch-writing" in _Jakarta Persistence API
(JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_.
* Statement caching – See "jdbc.cache-statements" in _Jakarta
Persistence API (JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_.
* Read and write connection pool size – See "connection-pool" in
_Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_.
* Session cache size – See "maintain-cache" in _Jakarta Persistence API
(JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_.

*Use the Workbench rather than manual coding.* These tools are not only
easy to use: the default configuration they export to deployment XML
(and the code it generates, if required) represents best practices
optimized for most applications.

[#TLADG449]##

[#sthref151]##

==== Schema

Optimization is an important consideration when you design your database
schema and object model. Most performance issues occur when the object
model or database schema is too complex, as this can make the database
slow and difficult to query. This is most likely to happen if you derive
your database schema directly from a complex object model.

To optimize performance, design the object model and database schema
together. However, allow each model to be designed optimally: do not
require a direct one-to-one correlation between the two.

Possible ways to optimize the schema include:

* Aggregating two tables into one
* Splitting one table into many
* Using a collapsed hierarchy
* Choosing one out of many

See "Data Storage Schema" in _EclipseLink Concepts_ for additional
information.

[#TLADG450]##

[#sthref152]##

==== Mappings and Descriptors

If you find performance bottlenecks in your mapping and descriptors, try
these solutions:

* Always use indirection (lazy loading). It is not only critical in
optimizing database access, but also allows EclipseLink to make several
other optimizations including optimizing its cache access and unit of
work processing. See "cache-usage" in _Jakarta Persistence API (JPA)
Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_.
* Avoid using method access in your EclipseLink mappings, especially if
you have expensive or potentially dangerous side-effect code in your get
or set methods; use the default direct attribute access instead. See
"Using Method or Direct Field Access" in the _EclipseLink Concepts_.
* Avoid using the existence checking option checkCacheThenDatabase on
descriptors, unless required by the application. The default existence
checking behavior offers better performance. See "@ExistenceChecking" in
_Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_.
* Avoid expensive initialization in the default constructor that
EclipseLink uses to instantiate objects. Instead, use lazy
initialization or use an EclipseLink instantiation policy to configure
the descriptor to use a different constructor. See
"@InstantiationCopyPolicy" in _Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) Extensions
Reference for EclipseLink_.

[#TLADG452]##

[#sthref153]##

==== Cache

You can often improve performance through caching, even in a clustered
environment by implementing cache coordination. Cache coordination
allows multiple, possibly distributed instances of a session to
broadcast object changes among each other so that each session's cache
can be kept up-to-date. For detailed information about optimizing cache
behavior, see "Understanding Caching" in _EclipseLink Concepts_ and the
following examples:

* `http://wiki.eclipse.org/EclipseLink/Examples/JPA/Caching`
* `http://wiki.eclipse.org/EclipseLink/Examples/JPA/CacheCoordination`
* `http://wiki.eclipse.org/EclipseLink/Examples/JPA/DCN`

[#TLADG453]##

[#sthref154]##

==== Data Access

Depending on the type of data source your application accesses,
EclipseLink offers a variety of `Login` options that you can use to tune
the performance of low level data reads and writes. For optimizing
higher-level data reads and writes, "Understanding Data Access" in
_EclipseLink Concepts_ offers several techniques to improve data access
performance for your application. These techniques show you how to:

* Optimize JDBC driver properties.
* Optimize data format.
* Use batch writing for optimization.
* Use Outer-Join Reading with Inherited Subclasses.
* Use Parameterized SQL (Parameter Binding) and Prepared Statement
Caching for Optimization.

[#TLADG454]##

[#sthref155]##

==== Queries

EclipseLink provides an extensive query API for reading, writing, and
updating data. "Understanding EclipseLink Queries" in _EclipseLink
Concepts_ offers several techniques to improve query performance for
your application. These techniques show you how to:

* Use parameterized SQL and prepared statement caching for optimization.
* Use named queries for optimization.
* Use batch and join reading for optimization.
* Use partial object queries and fetch groups for optimization.
* Use read-only queries for optimization.
* Use JDBC fetch size for optimization.
* Use cursored streams and scrollable cursors for optimization.
* Use result set pagination for optimization.

It also includes links to read and write optimization examples.

[#TLADG456]##

[#sthref156]##

==== Application Server and Database Optimization

To optimize the application server and database performance, consider
these techniques:

* Configuring your application server and database correctly can have a
big impact on performance and scalability. Ensure that you correctly
optimize these key components of your application in addition to your
EclipseLink application and persistence.
* For your application or Jakarta EE server, ensure your memory, thread
pool and connection pool sizes are sufficient for your server's expected
load, and that your JVM has been configured optimally.
* Ensure that your database has been configured correctly for optimal
performance and its expected load.

=== Task 6: Measure Performance Again

Finally, after identifying possible performance bottlenecks and taking
some action on them, rerun your application, again with the profiler
enabled (see link:#CHDDAEHF[Enabling the EclipseLink Profiler]). Review
the results and, if more action is required, follow the procedures
outlined in link:#CHDDCABJ[Task 5: Modify Poorly-Performing Application
Components].
