== [.secnum]#14# Tenant Isolation Using EclipseLink

With EclipseLink, you can develop a single application and then deploy
it for different clients, or "tenants," with varying degrees of
application and data isolation and of tenant-specific functionality. For
example, a large company may develop a single payroll application to be
used by multiple divisions. Each division has access to its own data and
to shared data, but they cannot see any other division's data.

This chapter includes the following sections:

* link:multitenancy001.htm#A1261503[Introduction to the Solution]
* link:multitenancy002.htm#BABJGBCF[Using Single-Table Multi-Tenancy]
* link:multitenancy003.htm#A1235913[Using Table-Per-Tenant
Multi-Tenancy]
* link:multitenancy004.htm#CHDJEBAC[Using VPD Multi-Tenancy]
* link:multitenancy005.htm#CHDCAJIH[Additional Resources]

[#TLADG1124]##

*Use Case*

Multiple application clients must share data sources, with private
access to their data, for example in a Software as a Service (SaaS)
environment.

[#TLADG1125]##

*Solution*

Decide on a strategy for tenant isolation; then use EclipseLink's tenant
isolation features to implement the strategy.

[#TLADG1126]##

*Components*

* EclipseLink 2.4 or later.
* A compliant Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) database, such as Oracle
Database, Oracle Express, or MySQL.
