== Introduction to the Solution

Oracle GlassFish Server is the reference implementation of the Java
Platform, Enterprise Edition (Jakarta EE platform) specification. Built
using the GlassFish Server Open Source Edition, GlassFish Server
delivers a flexible, lightweight, and production-ready Jakarta EE
platform.

GlassFish Server is part of the Oracle Fusion Middleware application
grid portfolio of products and is ideally suited for applications
requiring lightweight infrastructure with the most up-to-date
implementation of the Jakarta EE platform. GlassFish Server complements
Oracle WebLogic Server, which is designed to run the broader portfolio
of Oracle Fusion Middleware and large-scale enterprise applications.

=== Advantages to Using EclipseLink with GlassFish Server

By adding EclipseLink support, developers writing applications for the
GlassFish Server platform can achieve full Java-to-data source
integration that complies with the Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) 2.0
specification. EclipseLink allows you to integrate Java applications
with any data source, without compromising ideal application design or
data integrity. In addition, EclipseLink gives your GlassFish Server
platform applications the ability to store (that is, _persist_) and
retrieve business domain objects using a relational database or an XML
data source as a repository.

While GlassFish Server can use other persistence providers and
EclipseLink can be used with other application servers, using GlassFish
Server with EclipseLink provides a number of advantages:

* EclipseLink is included in all GlassFish Server distributions and is
the default JPA provider.
* EclipseLink logging integration in GlassFish Server provides a
comprehensive, integrated logging infrastructure.
* EclipseLink MOXy is also included in GlassFish versions 3.1.2 and
later. Although it is not the default JAXB implementation, it can be
used in JAX-WS and JAX-RS applications. For more information, see:
