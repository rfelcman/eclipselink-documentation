== Introduction to the Solution

Hibernate is an object-relational mapping (ORM) tool for Java
environments. It provides a framework for mapping Java objects to
relational database artifacts, and Java data types to SQL data types. It
also provides the ability to query the database and retrieve data.

For more information about Hibernate, see `http://www.hibernate.org`.

*Reasons to Migrate*

Reasons why you would want to migrate from Hibernate to EclipseLink
include:

* *Performance and scalability*: EclipseLink's caching architecture
allows you to minimize object creation and share instances.
EclipseLink's caching supports single-node and clustered deployments.
* *Support for leading relation databases*: EclipseLink continues to
support all leading relational databases with extensions specific to
each. EclipseLink is also the best ORM solution for Oracle Database.
* *A comprehensive persistence solution*: While EclipseLink offers
industry leading object-relational support, EclipseLink also uses its
core mapping functionality to deliver Object-XML (JAXB), Service Data
Object (SDO), and Database Web Services (DBWS). Depending on your
requirements, you can use one or more of the persistence services based
on the same core persistence engine.
* *JPA Support*: EclipseLink is the JPA reference implementation, and it
will support future versions of JPA.
