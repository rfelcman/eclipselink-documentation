== Introduction to the Solution

EclipseLink applications that are deployed to an application server
cluster benefit from cluster scalability, load balancing, and failover.
These capabilities ensure that EclipseLink applications are highly
available and scale as application demand increases. EclipseLink
applications are deployed the same way in application server clusters as
they are in standalone server environments. However, additional planning
and configuration is required to ensure cache consistency in an
application server cluster.

EclipseLink uses a shared (L2) object cache that avoids database access
for objects and their relationships. The cache is enabled by default and
enhances application performance. In an application server cluster,
caching can result in consistency issues (such as stale data) because
changes made on one server are not reflected on objects cached in other
servers. Cache consistency is problematic only for objects that are
frequently updated. Read-only objects are not affected by cache
consistency. For more details about caching, see:

`http://wiki.eclipse.org/EclipseLink/UserGuide/JPA/Basic_JPA_Development/Caching/Caching_Overview`

Various options are available for addressing cache consistency:

* Use cache coordination. Cache coordination is a feature that
broadcasts changes between the servers in the cluster to update or
invalidate changed objects.
* Use distributed caching. EclipseLink Grid is an integration between
EclipseLink and Oracle Coherence that addresses many cache consistency
issues that result from operating in a distributed environment. For
details on EclipseLink Grid, see
* Use optimistic locking. Optimistic locking is a feature that prevents
updates to stale objects, and triggers the objects to be invalidated in
the cache.
* Refresh the cache. Refreshing a cache loads that latest data in the
cache.
* Disable the shared cache for highly volatile entities or limit the
cache to read-only objects.
