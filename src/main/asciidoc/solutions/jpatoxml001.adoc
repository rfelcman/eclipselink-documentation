== Introduction to the Solution

This chapter demonstrates some typical techniques for mapping JPA
entities to XML. Working with the examples that follow requires some
understanding of such high-level JPA-to-XML mapping concepts, such as
JAXB, MOXy, XML binding, and how to override JAXB annotations. The
following sections will give you a basic understanding of these
concepts:

* link:#BEIEHDIH[Understanding XML Binding]
* link:#BEIJHDEG[Understanding JAXB]
* link:#BEIGAIEH[Understanding MOXy]
* link:#BEIHEGED[Understanding an XML Data Representation]

[#BEIEHDIH]####[#TLADG289]####

=== Understanding XML Binding

XML binding is how you represent information in an XML document as an
object in computer memory. This allows applications to access the data
in the XML from the object rather than using the Domain Object Model
(DOM), the Simple API for XML (SAX) or the Streaming API for XML (StAX)
to retrieve the data from a direct representation of the XML itself.
When binding, JAXB applies a tree structure to the graph of JPA
entities. Multiple tree representations of a graph are possible and will
depend on the root object chosen and the direction the relationships are
traversed.

You can find examples of XML binding with JAXB in
link:jpatoxml002.htm#BEIGDBHI[Binding JPA Entities to XML].

=== Understanding JAXB

JAXB is a Java API that allows a Java program to access an XML document
by presenting that document to the program in a Java format. This
process, called binding, represents information in an XML document as an
object in computer memory. In this way, applications can access the data
in the XML from the object rather than using the Domain Object Model
(DOM) or the Streaming API for XML (SAX) to retrieve the data from a
direct representation of the XML itself. Usually, an XML binding is used
with JPA entities to create a data access service by leveraging a JAX-WS
or JAX-RS implementation. Both of these Web Service standards use JAXB
as the default binding layer. This service provides a means to access
data exposed by JPA across computers, where the client computer might or
might not be using Java.

JAXB uses an extended set of annotations to define the binding rules for
Java-to-XML mapping. These annotations are subclasses of the
`jakarta.xml.bind.`__`*`__ packages in the EclipseLink API. For more
information about these annotations, see _Java API Reference for
EclipseLink_.

For more information about JAXB, see "Java Architecture for XML Binding
(JAXB)" at:

`http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/moxy.php`

=== Understanding MOXy

MOXy is EclipseLink's JAXB implementation. It allows you to map a POJO
model to an XML schema, greatly enhancing your ability to create
JPA-to-XML mappings. MOXy supports all the standard JAXB annotations in
the `jakarta.xml.bind.annotation` package plus has its own extensions in
the `org.eclipse.persistence.oxm.annotations` package. You can use these
latter annotations in conjunction with the standard annotations to
extend the utility of JAXB. Because MOXy represents the optimal JAXB
implementation, you still implement it whether or not you explicitly use
any of its extensions. MOXy offers these benefits:

* It allows you to map your own classes to your own XML schema, a
process called "Meet in the Middle Mapping". This avoids static coupling
of your mapped classes with a single XML schema,
* It offers specific features, such as Xpath-based mapping, JSON
binding, and compound key mapping and mapping relationships with
back-pointers to address critical JPA-to-XML mapping issues.
* It allows you to map your existing JPA models to industry standard
schema.
* It allows you to combine MOXy mappings and EclipseLink's persistence
framework to interact with your data through JCA.
* It offers superior performance in several scenarios.

For more information about MOXy, see the MOXy FAQ at:

`http://wiki.eclipse.org/EclipseLink/FAQ/WhatIsMOXy`

=== Understanding an XML Data Representation

Annotations are not always the most effective way to map JPA to XML. For
example, you would not use JAXB if:

* You want to specify metadata for a third-party class but do not have
access to the source.
* You want to map an object model to multiple XML schemas, because JAXB
rules preclude applying more than one mapping by using annotations.
* Your object model already contains too many annotations—for example,
from such services as JPA, Spring, JSR-303, and so on—and you want to
specify the metadata elsewhere.

Under these and similar circumstances, you can use an XML data
representation by exposing the `eclipselink_oxm.xml` file.

XML metadata works in two modes:

* It adds to the metadata supplied by annotations. This is useful when:
** Annotations define version one of the XML representation, and you use
XML metadata to tweak the metadata for future versions.
** You use the standard JAXB annotations, and use the XML metadata for
the MOXy extensions. In this way you don't introduce new compile time
dependencies in the object model.
* It completely replaces the annotation metadata, which is useful when
you want to map to different XML representations.

Override JAXB Annotations]
