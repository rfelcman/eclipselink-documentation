== Introduction to the Solution

"Native" TopLink ORM refers to the API, configuration files, and tools
for object-relational mapping that evolved in TopLink before the Jakarta
Persistence API (JPA) standardized an object-relational mapping API.
Full JPA support was introduced in Oracle TopLink 10__g__ (10.1.3.1.0),
via TopLink Essentials. However, native TopLink continued to be
supported.

Prior to the TopLink 11__g__ (11.1.1) release, Oracle contributed the
TopLink source code--including TopLink JPA and native TopLink--to the
Eclipse Foundation, where it was used to form the basis of the
open-source EclipseLink persistence services project. Then, in TopLink
11__g__ Release 1 (11.1.1), Oracle started to include EclipseLink in
TopLink, providing TopLink's core functionality.

EclipseLink developers using TopLink versions 11.1.1.0.0 though
11.1.1.6.0 have access to native TopLink ORM in either the proprietary
Oracle `toplink.jar` or in the EclipseLink `eclipselink.jar`. In
`toplink.jar`, the classes are in packages whose names start with
`oracle.toplink.*`. In `eclipselink.jar`, those package names begin
instead with `org.eclipselink.persistence.`.

The `toplink.jar` file was deprecated in TopLink 11__g__ and is no long
shipped with TopLink 12__c__. It is recommended that you migrate off
`oracle.toplink.*` in TopLink 11__g__.

|===

 +

You can migrate applications that use `oracle.toplink.*` packages from
`toplink.jar` to use `org.eclipselink.persistence.` packages from
`eclipselink.jar`. The application functionality remains the same, but
migrating to `eclipselink.jar` provides the most up-to-date code base.
After migrating, you will have access to other EclipseLink features and
will be better prepared to convert your application to use JPA or one of
the other persistence services included in current versions of
EclipseLink.

This chapter explains how to use the renaming tool that is packaged with
stand-alone EclipseLink to easily change the package names in your
application and how to perform other actions necessary to migrate to the
current code base.

Following the instructions in this chapter will update your application
to use the current EclipseLink code base. Doing so retains the design
and functionality of your application as originally implemented.
However, these instructions do not describe how to convert a native
TopLink-based application to use JPA or any of the other persistence
services in current versions of EclipseLink. See the other EclipseLink
documentation sources for that information.
