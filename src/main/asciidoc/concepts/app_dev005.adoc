About Weaving
-------------

Weaving is a technique of manipulating the byte-code of compiled Java
classes. The EclipseLink JPA persistence provider uses weaving to
enhance both JPA entities and Plain Old Java Object (POJO) classes for
such things as lazy loading, change tracking, fetch groups, and internal
optimizations.

Weaving can be performed either dynamically at runtime, when entities
are loaded, or statically at compile time by post-processing the entity
`.class` files. By default, EclipseLink uses dynamic weaving whenever
possible, including inside a Jakarta EE application server and in Java
SE when the EclipseLink agent is configured. Dynamic weaving is
recommended as it is easy to configure and does not require any changes
to a project's build process.

This section describes the following:

* link:#CCHGIFEG[Using Static Weaving]

[[CCHHBDAJ]][[OTLCG91217]]

Using Dynamic Weaving
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use dynamic weaving to weave application class files one at a time, as
they are loaded at run time. Consider this option when the number of
classes to weave is few or when the time taken to weave the classes is
short.

If the number of classes to weave is large or the time required to weave
the classes is long, consider using static weaving.

[[CCHGIFEG]][[OTLCG91219]]

Using Static Weaving
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use static weaving to weave all application class files at build time so
that you can deliver prewoven class files. Consider this option to weave
all applicable class files at build time so that you can deliver
prewoven class files. By doing so, you can improve application
performance by eliminating the runtime weaving step required by dynamic
weaving.

In addition, consider using static weaving to weave in Java environments
where you cannot configure an agent.

[[CHDHAAHE]][[OTLCG94274]]

Weaving POJO Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EclipseLink uses weaving to enable the following for POJO classes:

* Lazy loading
* Change tracking
* Fetch groups

EclipseLink weaves all the POJO classes in the JAR you create when you
package a POJO application for weaving.

EclipseLink weaves all the classes defined in the `persistence.xml`
file, that is:

* All the classes you list in the `persistence.xml` file.
* All classes relative to the JAR containing the `persistence.xml` file
if element `<exclude-unlisted-classes>` is false.

[[CHDGACIJ]][[OTLCG94275]]

Weaving and Jakarta EE Application Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default EclipseLink weaving behavior applies in any Jakarta EE
JPA-compliant application server using the EclipseLink JPA persistence
provider. To change this behavior, modify your `persistence.xml` file
(for your JPA entities or POJO classes) to use EclipseLink JPA
properties, EclipseLink JPA annotations, or both.

[[CHDECEBI]][[OTLCG94276]]

Disabling Weaving with Persistence Unit Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To disable weaving using EclipseLink persistence unit properties,
configure your `persistence.xml` file with one or more of the following
properties set to false:

* `eclipse.weaving`; disables all weaving
* `eclipselink.weaving.lazy`; disables weaving for lazy loading
(indirection)
* `eclipselink.weaving.changetracking`; disables weaving for change
tracking
* `eclipselink.weaving.fetchgroups`; disables weaving for fetch groups
* `eclipselink.weaving.internal`; disables weaving for internal
optimization
* `eclipselink.weaving.eager`; disables weaving for indirection on eager
relationships
