About Tenant Isolation
----------------------

EclipseLink offers considerable flexibility in how you can design and
implement features for isolating tenants. Possibilities include the
following:

*Application Isolation options*

* Separate container/server
* Separate application within the same container/server
* Separate entity manager factory and shared cache within the same
application
* Shared entity manager factory with tenant isolation per entity manager

*Data isolation options*

* Separate database
* Separate schema/tablespace
* Separate tables
* Shared table with row isolation
* Query filtering
* Oracle Virtual Private Database (VPD)

EclipseLink includes the following options for providing multi-tenancy
in the data source:

* *Single-table multi-tenancy* allows tenants to share tables. Each
tenant has its own rows, identified by discriminator columns, and those
rows are invisible to other tenants. See link:#BEIBAJBE[Single Table
Multi-Tenancy.]
* With *table-per-tenant* multi-tenancy, each tenant has its own table
or tables, identified by table tenant discriminators, and those tables
are invisible to other users. See link:#BEIHJCBG[Table-Per-Tenant
Multi-Tenancy.]
* With (*VDP*) multi-tenancy, tenants use a VDP database, which provides
the functionality to support multiple tenants sharing the same table.
See link:#BEIJCDEA[VPD Multi-Tenancy.]

[[BEIBAJBE]]

Single Table Multi-Tenancy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With single-table multi-tenancy, any table (`Table` or `SecondaryTable`)
to which an entity or mapped superclass maps can include rows for
multiple tenants. Access to tenant-specific rows is restricted to the
specified tenant.

Tenant-specific rows are associated with the tenant by using one or more
tenant discriminator columns. Discriminator columns are used with
application context values to limit what a persistence context can
access.

The results of queries on the mapped tables are limited to the tenant
discriminator value(s) provided as property values. This applies to all
insert, update, and delete operations on the table. When multi-tenant
metadata is applied at the mapped superclass level, it is applied to all
subentities unless they specify their own multi-tenant metadata.

[[BEIHJCBG]]

Table-Per-Tenant Multi-Tenancy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Table-per-tenant multi-tenancy allows multiple tenants of an application
to isolate their data in one or more tenant-specific tables. Multiple
tenants' tables can be in a shared schema, identified using a prefix or
suffix naming pattern; or they can be in separate, tenant-specific
schemas. Table-per-tenant entities can be mixed with other multi-tenant
type entities within the same persistence unit.

The table-per-tenant multi-tenant type is used in conjunction with:

* A tenant table discriminator that specifies the type of discriminator
(schema or name with prefix or suffix)
* A tenant ID to identify the user (configured per entity manager or at
the entity manager factory, if isolating the table-per-tenant per
persistence unit.)

A single application instance with a shared `EntityManagerFactory` for a
persistence unit can be responsible for handling requests from multiple
tenants.

Alternatively, separate `EntityManagerFactory` instances can be used for
each tenant. (This is required when using extensions per tenant.) In
this case, tenant-specific schema and table names are defined in an
`eclipselink-orm.xml` configuration file. A `MetadataSource` must be
registered with a persistence unit. The `MetadataSource` is used to
support additional persistence unit metadata provided from outside the
application. See also `metadata-source` in _Jakarta Persistence API
(JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_.

The table-per-tenant multi-tenant type enables individual tenant
table(s) to be used at the entity level. A tenant context property must
be provided on each entity manager after a transaction has started.

* The table(s) (`Table` and `SecondaryTable`) for the entity are
individual tenant tables based on the tenant context. Relationships
within an entity that uses a join or a collection table are also assumed
to exist within the table-per-tenant context.
* Multi-tenant metadata can only be applied at the root level of the
inheritance hierarchy when using a `SINGLE_TABLE` or `JOINED`
inheritance strategy. Multi-tenant metadata can be specified in a
`TABLE_PER_CLASS` inheritance hierarchy.

For information on constructing table-per-tenant multi-tenancy, see
"Using Table-Per-Tenant Multi-Tenancy" in _Solutions Guide for
EclipseLink_.

VPD Multi-Tenancy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Virtual Private Database (VPD) uses security controls to restrict
access to database objects based on various parameters.

For example, the Oracle Virtual Private Database supports security
policies that control database access at the row and column level.
Oracle VPD adds a dynamic `WHERE` clause to SQL statements issued
against the table, view, or synonym to which the security policy was
applied.

Oracle Virtual Private Database enforces security directly on the
database tables, views, or synonyms. Because security policies are
attached directly to these database objects, and the policies are
automatically applied whenever a user accesses data, there is no way to
bypass security.

When a user directly or indirectly accesses a table, view, or synonym
that is protected with an Oracle Virtual Private Database policy, Oracle
Database dynamically modifies the SQL statement of the user. This
modification creates a `WHERE` condition (called a predicate) returned
by a function implementing the security policy. Oracle Virtual Private
Database modifies the statement dynamically, transparently to the user,
using any condition that can be expressed in or returned by a function.
Oracle Virtual Private Database policies can be applied to `SELECT`,
`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `INDEX`, and `DELETE` statements.

When using EclipseLink VPD Multitenancy, the database handles the tenant
filtering on all `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `INDEX` and `DELETE`
queries.

To use EclipseLink VPD multi-tenancy, you must first configure VPD in
the database and then specify multi-tenancy on the entity or mapped
superclass using `@Multitenant` and `@TenantDiscriminatorColumn`
annotations.

For more information on constructing VPD Multi-Tenancy, see
"link:olinkTLADG501[Using VPD Multi-Tenancy]" in _Solutions Guide for
EclipseLink_.
