About JPQL Queries
------------------

The Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) is the query language defined
by JPA. JPQL is similar to SQL, but operates on objects, attributes and
relationships instead of tables and columns. JPQL can be used for
reading (`SELECT`), as well as bulk updates (`UPDATE`) and deletes
(`DELETE`). JPQL can be used in a `NamedQuery` (through annotations or
XML) or in dynamic queries using the `EntityManager` `createQuery()`
API.

The disadvantage of JPQL is that dynamic queries require performing
string concatenations to build queries dynamically from web forms or
dynamic content. JPQL is also not checked until runtime, making
typographical errors more common. These disadvantages are reduced by
using the query Criteria API, described
link:queries004.htm#A7714964[About the Criteria API.]

EclipseLink Extensions to JPQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EclipseLink supports all of the statements and clauses described in
"Query Language" in the JPA Specification, including `SELECT` queries,
update and delete statements, `WHERE` clauses, literal values, and
database functions. For more information, see the JPA Specification.

`http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338`

EclipseLink provides many extensions to the standard JPA JPQL. These
extensions provide access to additional database features many of which
are part of the SQL standard, provide access to native database features
and functions, and provide access to EclipseLink specific features.

EclipseLink's JPQL extensions include:

* Less restrictions than JPQL, allows sub-selects and functions within
operations such as `LIKE`, `IN`, `ORDER` `BY`, constructors, functions
etc.
* Allow != in place of <>
* `FUNCTION` operation to call database specific functions
* `TREAT` operation to downcast related entities with inheritance
* `OPERATOR` operation to call EclipseLink database independent
functions
* `SQL` operation to mix `SQL` with JPQL
* `CAST` and `EXTRACT` functions
* `REGEXP` function for regular expression querying
* Usage of sub-selects in the `SELECT` and `FROM` clause
* `ON` clause support for defining `JOIN` and `LEFT` `JOIN` conditions
* Joins between independent entities
* Usage of an alias on a `JOIN` `FETCH`
* `COLUMN` operation to allow querying on nonmapped columns
* `TABLE` operation to allow querying on non mapped tables
* `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT` support
* Usage of object variables in =, <>, `IN`, `IS` `NULL`, and `ORDER`
`BY`

For descriptions of these extensions, see "EclipseLink Query Language"
in _Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_.

[[CIHBIDFG]][[OTLCG94374]]

EclipseLink Special Operators in JPQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EclipseLink defines several special JPQL operators that allow performing
database operations that are not possible in basic JPQL. These include:

* `COLUMN`
* `FUNCTION`
* `OPERATOR`
* `SQL`

For descriptions of these operators, see "Special Operators" in _Jakarta
Persistence API (JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_.
