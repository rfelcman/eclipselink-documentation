Database Event Notification and Oracle CQN
------------------------------------------

Some databases and database products allow events to be raised from the
database when rows are updated or deleted.

EclipseLink supports an API to allow the database to notify EclipseLink
of database changes, so the changed objects can be invalidated in the
EclipseLink shared cache. This allows a shared cache to be used, and
stale data to be avoided, even if other applications access the same
data in the database. EclipseLink supports integration with the Oracle
Database feature for Database Change Notification CQN. A custom
`DatabaseEventListener` may be provided for other databases and products
that support database events.

There are also other solutions to caching in a shared environment,
including:

* Disable the shared cache (through setting `@Cacheable(false)`, or
`@Cache(isolation=ISOLATED)`).
* Only cache read-only objects.
* Set a cache invalidation timeout to reduce stale data.
* Use refreshing on objects/queries when fresh data is required.
* Use optimistic locking to ensure write consistency (writes on stale
data will fail, and will automatically invalidate the cache).

The JPA Cache API and the EclipseLink `JpaCache` API can also be used
directly to invalidate objects in the shared cache by the application.
EclipseLink cache coordination could also be used to send invalidation
messages to a cluster of EclipseLink persistence units.

Database events can reduce the chance of an application getting stale
data, but do not eliminate the possibility. Optimistic locking should
still be used to ensure data integrity. Even in a single server
application stale data is still possible within a persistence context
unless pessimistic locking is used. Optimistic (or pessimistic) locking
is always required to ensure data integrity in any multi-user system.

Oracle Continuous Query Notification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Oracle database released a Continuous Query Notification (CQN)
feature in the 10.2 release. CQN allows for database events to be raised
when the rows in a table are modified. The JDBC API for CQN was not
complete until 11.2, so 11.2 is required for EclipseLink's integration.

EclipseLink CQN support is enabled by the
`OracleChangeNotificationListener` listener which integrates with Oracle
JDBC to received database change events. Use the
`eclipselink.cache.database-event-listener` property to configure the
full class name of the listener.

By default all tables in the persistence unit are registered for change
notification, but this can be configured using the
`databaseChangeNotificationType` attribute of the `@Cache` annotation to
selectively disable change notification for certain classes.

Oracle CQN uses the `ROWID` to inform of row level changes. This
requires EclipseLink to include the `ROWID` in all queries for a CQN
enabled class. EclipseLink must also select the object's `ROWID` after
an insert operation. EclipseLink must maintain a cache index on the
`ROWID`, in addition to the object's Id. EclipseLink also selects the
database transaction Id once each transaction to avoid invalidating the
cache on the server that is processing the transaction.

EclipseLink's CQN integration has the following limitations:

* Changes to an object's secondary tables will not trigger it to be
invalidate unless a version is used and updated in the primary table.
* Changes to an object's OneToMany, ManyToMany, and ElementCollection
relationships will not trigger it to be invalidate unless a version is
used and updated in the primary table.
