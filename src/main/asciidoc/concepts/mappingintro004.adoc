Object-JSON Mapping Concepts
----------------------------

EclipseLink MOXy supports the ability to convert objects to and from
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). This feature is useful when creating
RESTful services; JAX-RS services can accept both XML and JSON messages.

EclipseLink supports all MOXy object-to-XML options when reading and
writing JSON, including:

* EclipseLink's advanced and extended mapping features (in addition to
the JAXB specification)
* Storing mappings in external bindings files
* Creating dynamic models with Dynamic JAXB
* Building extensible models that support multitenant applications

EclipseLink provides the following support for mapping JSON documents:

* JSON bindings that do not require compile time dependencies, in
addition to those required for normal JAXB use. You can also write MOXy
External Bindings files as JSON documents.
* Although XML has a single datatype, JSON differentiates between
strings, numbers, and booleans. EclipseLink supports these datatypes
automatically.
* JSON does not use attributes; anything mapped with a `@XmlAttribute`
annotation will be marshalled as an element. By default, EclipseLink
triggers both the attribute and element events, thereby allowing either
the mapped attribute or element to handle the value.
* EclipseLink supports JSON documents without a root element. By
default, if no `@XmlRootElement` annotation exists, the marshalled JSON
document will not have a root element. With EclipseLink, you can
override this behavior (that is, omit the root element from the JSON
output).
* Because JSON does not use namespaces, all namespaces and prefixes are
ignored by default when marshaling and unmarshaling. With EclipseLink,
you can supply a `Map` of namespace-to-prefix (or an instance of
`NamespacePrefixMapper`) to the marshaller and unmarshaller. The
namespace prefix will appear in the marshalled document prepended to the
element name.
* By default, when marshalling to JSON, EclipseLink marshals empty
collections as [ ], EclipseLink allows you to override this behavior, so
that empty collections are not marshalled at all.
* You can marshal and unmarshal root-level collections.
