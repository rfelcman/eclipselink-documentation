About Authentication
--------------------

*Authentication* is the means by which a data source validates a user's
identity and determines whether the user has sufficient privileges to
perform a given action. Authentication plays a central role in data
security and user accountability and auditing.

For two-tier applications, simple JDBC authentication is usually
sufficient.

The following sections describe the different authentication strategies:

* link:#CHDEIDHF[Simple JDBC Authentication]
* link:#CHDFACHD[Oracle Database Proxy Authentication]
* link:#CHDFCJDB[Auditing]

[[CHDEIDHF]][[OTLCG93606]]

Simple JDBC Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you configure an EclipseLink database login with a user name and
password, EclipseLink provides these credentials to the JDBC driver that
you configure your application to use.

By default, EclipseLink reads passwords from the `persistence.xml` file.

[[CHDFACHD]][[OTLCG93607]]

Oracle Database Proxy Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EclipseLink supports proxy authentication with Oracle Database in Java
SE applications and Jakarta EE applications with the Oracle JDBC driver
and external connection pools only.

image:../../dcommon/images/note_icon.png[Note,width=16,height=16]Note:

EclipseLink does not support Oracle Database proxy authentication with
JTA.

|=======================================================================

 +

Oracle Database proxy authentication delivers the following security
benefits:

* A limited trust model, by controlling the users on whose behalf middle
tiers can connect, and the roles the middle tiers can assume for the
user.
* Scalability, by supporting user sessions through Oracle Call Interface
(OCI) and thick JDBC, and eliminating the overhead of reauthenticating
clients.
* Accountability, by preserving the identity of the real user through to
the database, and enabling auditing of actions taken on behalf of the
real user.
* Flexibility, by supporting environments in which users are known to
the database, and in which users are merely "application users" of which
the database has no awareness.

image:../../dcommon/images/note_icon.png[Note,width=16,height=16]Note:

Oracle Database supports proxy authentication in three-tiers only; it
does not support it across multiple middle tiers.

|=======================================================================

 +

For more information about authentication in Oracle Database, see
"Preserving User Identity in Multitiered Environments" in the _Oracle
Database Security Guide_.

Configure your EclipseLink database login to use proxy authentication to
do the following:

* address the complexities of authentication in a three-tier
architecture (such as client-to-middle-tier and middle-tier-to-database
authentication, and client reauthentication through the middle -tier to
the database)
* enhance database audit information (for even triggers and stored
procedures) by using a specific user for database operations, rather
than the generic pool user
* simplify VPD/OLS configuration by using a proxy user, rather than
setting user information directly in the session context with stored
procedures

[[CHDFCJDB]][[OTLCG93608]]

Auditing
~~~~~~~~

Regardless of what type of authentication you choose, EclipseLink logs
the name of the user associated with all database operations.
link:#CHDHDDGJ[Example 7-1] shows the `CONFIG` level EclipseLink logs
when a `ServerSession` connects through the main connection for the
sample user "scott", and a `ClientSession` uses proxy connection "jeff"

Your database server likely provides additional user auditing options.
Consult your database server documentation for details.

Alternatively, you may consider using the EclipseLink persistence unit
in conjunction with your database schema for auditing purposes.
