Key Tools
---------

This section describes the support for EclipseLink provided by Oracle
JDeveloper, Eclipse, and NetBeans development environments. Any tooling
is compatible with EclipseLink, but these offer specific integration.

This section contains the following subsections:

* link:#BABGBABF[Oracle JDeveloper]
* link:#BABDFFCB[Eclipse]
* link:#BABCCIDI[NetBeans]

[[BABGBABF]][[OTLCG166]]

Oracle JDeveloper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Oracle JDeveloper is a Jakarta EE development environment with
end-to-end support to develop, debug, and deploy e-business applications
and web services.

For JDeveloper information and downloads, see:

`http://www.oracle.com/us/products/tools/019657.htm`

JDeveloper includes a number of features to aid in the development of
applications that use EclipseLink. These features include wizards to
reverse engineer JPA entities from database tables and to generate EJB
3.0 Session Beans with `EntityManager` injection. It also includes
methods for querying JPA entities and to test client generation.

JDeveloper tools enable you to quickly and easily configure and map your
Java classes and JPA entities to different data sources, including
relational databases and XML schemas without using code.

DBWSBuilder script (included in EclipseLink install) can be used to run
the DBWSBuilder utility to generate the Web service. JDeveloper uses the
API provided, but does not use the DBWSBuilder script directly.

For more information on Oracle JDeveloper's EclipseLink support, see
JDeveloper online help.

[[BABDFFCB]][[OTLCG168]]

Eclipse
~~~~~~~

The Eclipse IDE provides a number of features and utilities to help you
create, run, and maintain applications that use JPA. These capabilities
are extended if you install OEPE.

For Eclipse IDE information and downloads, see:

`http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/eclipse/overview/index.html`

The Dali Java Persistence Tools Project provides extensible frameworks
and tools for defining and editing object-relational mappings for JPA
entities. JPA mapping support focuses on minimizing the complexity of
mapping by providing entity generation wizards, design-time validation,
and a robust UI for entity and persistence unit configuration.

For Dali information and downloads, see:

`http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/dali`

Other tools and utilities from the Oracle, open source, and third party
vendor communities are available from the Eclipse Marketplace.

`http://marketplace.eclipse.org/`

[[BABCCIDI]][[OTLCG169]]

NetBeans
~~~~~~~~

NetBeans IDE bundles Oracle GlassFish Server, which includes
EclipseLink. The IDE provides full support for JPA-based code
development. This support includes entity class wizards for constructing
entities and editor hints to ensure that entities conform to the JPA
specification. NetBeans also provides a persistence unit editor for
constructing a `persistence.xml` file.

For NetBeans information and downloads, see:

`http://netbeans.org/index.html`
