About Connection Pools
----------------------

A *connection pool* is a service that creates and maintains a shared
collection (pool) of data source connections on behalf of one or more
clients. The connection pool provides a connection to a process on
request, and returns the connection to the pool when the process is
finished using it. When it is returned to the pool, the connection is
available for other processes. Because establishing a connection to a
data source can be time-consuming, reusing such connections in a
connection pool can improve performance.

EclipseLink uses connection pools to manage and share the connections
used by server and client sessions. This feature reduces the number of
connections required and allows your application to support many
clients.

You can configure your session to use internal connection pools provided
by EclipseLink or external connection pools provided by a JDBC driver or
Jakarta EE container.

You can use connection pools in your EclipseLink application for a
variety of purposes, such as reading, writing, sequencing, and other
application-specific functions.

This section describes the following types of connection pools:

* link:#CHDHEIJE[Internal Connection Pools]
* link:#CHDCAIEJ[External Connection Pools]
* link:#CHDJGAJE[Default (Write) and Read Connection Pools]
* link:#CHDEFJHH[Sequence Connection Pools]
* link:#CHDDGHGA[Application-Specific Connection Pools]

[[CHDHEIJE]][[OTLCG93611]]

Internal Connection Pools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For non-Jakarta EE applications, you typically use _internal_ connection
pools. By default, EclipseLink sessions use internal connection pools.

Using internal connection pools, you can configure the default (write)
and read connection pools. You can also create additional connection
pools for object identity, or any other purpose.

Internal connection pools allow you to optimize the creation of read
connections for applications that read data only to display it and only
infrequently modify data. This also allow you to use Workbench to
configure the default (write) and read connection pools and to create
additional connection pools for object identity or any other purpose.

[[CHDCAIEJ]][[OTLCG93612]]

External Connection Pools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For Jakarta EE applications, you typically use _external_ connection
pools. An external connection pool is a collection of reusable
connections to a single data source provided by a JDBC driver or Jakarta
EE container.

If you are using an external transaction controller (JTA), you must use
external connection pools to integrate with the JTA.

Using external connection pools, you can use Java to configure the
default (write) and read connection pools and create additional
connection pools for object identity, or any other purpose.

External connection pools enable your EclipseLink application to do the
following:

* Integrate into a Jakarta EE-enabled system.
* Integrate with JTA transactions (JTA transactions require a
JTA-enabled data source).
* Leverage a shared connection pool in which multiple applications use
the same data source.
* Use a data source configured and managed directly on the server.

[[CHDJGAJE]][[OTLCG93613]]

Default (Write) and Read Connection Pools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A server session provides a read connection pool and a write connection
pool. These could be different pools, or if you use external connection
pooling, the same connection pool.

All read queries use connections from the read connection pool and all
queries that write changes to the data source use connections from the
write connection pool. You can configure attributes of the default
(write) and read connection pools.

Whenever a new connection is established, EclipseLink uses the
connection configuration you specify in your session's
`DatasourceLogin`. Alternatively, when you use an external transaction
controller, you can define a separate connection configuration for a
read connection pool to avoid the additional overhead, if appropriate.

Use the `connection-pool.read` property to configure a read connection
pool for non-transaction read queries. By default, EclipseLink does not
use a separate read connection pool; the default pool is used for read
queries. For more information, see `connection-pool.read` in _Jakarta
Persistence API (JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_.

[[CHDEFJHH]][[OTLCG93614]]

Sequence Connection Pools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An essential part of maintaining object identity is sequencing–managing
the assignment of unique values to distinguish one instance from
another. For more information, see link:cache002.htm#CHEFCFEG[About
Cache Type and Size].

Sequencing involves reading and writing a special sequence resource
maintained by your data source.

By default, EclipseLink includes sequence operations in a separate
transaction. This avoids complications during the write transaction,
which may lead to deadlocks over the sequence resource. However, when
using an external transaction controller (such as a JTA data source or
connection pool), EclipseLink cannot use a different transaction for
sequencing. Use a sequence connection pool to configure a non-JTA
transaction pool for sequencing. This is required only for table
sequencing–not native sequencing.

In each server session, you can create one connection pool, called a
sequence connection pool, that EclipseLink uses exclusively for
sequencing. With a sequence connection pool, EclipseLink satisfies a
request for a new object identifier outside of the transaction from
which the request originates. This allows EclipseLink to immediately
commit an update to the sequence resource, which avoids deadlocks.

**Note*:*

If you use a sequence connection pool and the original transaction
fails, the sequence operation does not roll back.

You should use a sequence connection pool, if the following applies:

* You use table sequencing (that is, non-native sequencing).
* You use external transaction controller (JTA).

You should not use a sequence connection pool, if the following applies:

* You do not use sequencing, or use the data source's native sequencing.
* You have configured the sequence table to avoid deadlocks.
* You use non-JTA data sources.

You can configure a sequence connection pool with the
`eclipselink.connection-pool.sequence` persistence unit property. This
property allows the connection pool to allocate generated IDs, and is
required only for `TABLE` sequencing. By default, EclipseLink does not
use a separate sequence connection pool; the default pool is used for
sequencing. For more information, see `connection-pool.sequence` in
_Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_.

[[CHDDGHGA]][[OTLCG93615]]

Application-Specific Connection Pools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you use internal EclipseLink connection pools in a session, you can
create one or more connection pools that you can use for any application
purpose. These are called named connection pools, as you can give them
any name you want and use them for any purpose.

Typically, use these named connection pools to provide pools of
different security levels. For example, the "default" connection pool
may only allow access to specific tables but the "admin" connection pool
may allow access to all tables.
