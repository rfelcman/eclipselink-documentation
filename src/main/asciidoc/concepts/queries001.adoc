Query Concepts
--------------

In general, querying a data source means performing an action on or
interacting with the contents of the data source. To do this, you must
be able to perform the following:

* Define an action in a syntax native to the data source being queried.
* Apply the action in a controlled fashion.
* Manage the results returned by the action (if any).

You must also consider how the query affects the EclipseLink cache.

This section introduces query concepts unique to EclipseLink, including
the following:

* link:#CACJBFHJ[Call Objects]
* link:#CACFBJBF[DatabaseQuery Objects]
* link:#CACIAFDF[Data-Level and Object-Level Queries]
* link:#CACJGHBC[Summary Queries]
* link:#CACDCDFD[Descriptor Query Manager]
* link:#CACJAEDA[Query Keys]

[[CACJBFHJ]][[OTLCG93990]]

Call Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Call` object encapsulates an operation or action on a data source.
The EclipseLink API provides a variety of `Call` types such as
structured query language (SQL), Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL),
and Extensible Markup Language (XML).

You can execute a `Call` directly or in the context of the EclipseLink
`DatabaseQuery` object.

[[CACFBJBF]][[OTLCG93991]]

DatabaseQuery Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A `DatabaseQuery` object is an abstraction that associates additional
customization and optimization options with the action encapsulated by a
`Call`. By separating these options from the `Call`, EclipseLink can
provide sophisticated query capabilities across all `Call` types.

[[CACIAFDF]][[OTLCG93992]]

Data-Level and Object-Level Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Queries can be defined for objects or data, as follows:

* *Object-level* queries are object-specific and return data as objects
in your domain model. They are the preferred type of query for mapped
data. By far, object-level `DatabaseQuery` queries are the most common
query used in EclipseLink.
* *Data-level* queries are used to query database tables directly, and
are an appropriate way to work with unmapped data.

[[CACJGHBC]][[OTLCG93993]]

Summary Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While data-level queries return raw data and object-level queries return
objects in your domain model, summary queries return data about objects.
EclipseLink provides partial object queries to return a set of objects
with only specific attributes populated, and report queries to return
summarized (or rolled-up) data for specific attributes of a set of
objects.

[[CACDCDFD]][[OTLCG93994]]

Descriptor Query Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to storing named queries applicable to a particular class,
you can also use the `DescriptorQueryManager` to override the default
action that EclipseLink defines for common data source operations.

[[CACJAEDA]][[OTLCG93996]]

Query Keys
~~~~~~~~~~

A query key is a schema-independent alias for a database field name.
Using a query key, you can refer to a field using a schema-independent
alias. In relational projects only, EclipseLink automatically creates
query keys for all mapped attributes. The name of the query key is the
name of the class attribute specified in your object model.

You can configure query keys in a class descriptor or interface
descriptor. You can use query keys in expressions and to query variable
one-to-one mappings.

By default, EclipseLink creates query keys for all mapped attributes,
but in some scenarios you may find it beneficial to add your own.
