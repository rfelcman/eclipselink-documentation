= Understanding Caching

This chapter introduces and describes caching. The EclipseLink cache is
an in-memory repository that stores recently read or written objects
based on class and primary key values. The cache improves performance by
holding recently read or written objects and accessing them in-memory to
minimize database access, manage locking and isolation level, and manage
object identity.

The entity caching annotations defined by EclipseLink are listed in
"Caching Annotations" in _Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) Extensions
Reference for EclipseLink_.

EclipseLink also provides a number of persistence unit properties that
you can specify to configure the EclipseLink cache. These properties may
compliment or provide an alternative to annotations. For a list of these
properties, see "Caching" in _Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) Extensions
Reference for EclipseLink_.
