About Query Casting
-------------------

Use query casting to query across attributes in subclasses when using
JPA or ORM. This feature is available in JPQL, EclipseLink Expressions,
and Criteria API.

Starting with JPA 2.0, it is possible to limit the results or a query to
those of a specific subclass. For example, the expression framework
provides `Expression.type(Class)`.

In JPQL, downcasting is accomplished in the `FROM` clause, using
`TREAT`...`AS` in the `JOIN` clause.

The JPA `Criteria` API includes the casting operator
`Expression.as(type)`. This expression does a simple cast that allows
matching of types within the generics.

Calling a cast on a `JOIN` node permanently alters that node. For
example, in the example above, after calling
`join.as(LargeProject.class)`, the join refers to a `LargeProject`.

EclipseLink Expression Support for Downcasting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EclipseLink extends the `Criteria` API to allow a cast using
`Expression.as(type)`. The as method checks the hierarchy; and if type
is a subclass of the type for the expression that is being called on, a
cast is implemented.

The `Expression.as(Class)` can also be used for downcasting. The
behavior of using `Expression.as(Class)` is as follows:

* An exception is thrown at query execution time if the class that is
cast to is not a subclass of the class of the query key being cast.
* Casts are only allowed on `ObjectExpressions` (`QueryKeyExpression`
and `ExpressionBuilder`). The parent expression of a cast must be an
`ObjectExpression`.
* Casts use the same outer join settings as the `ObjectExpression` they
modify.
* Casts modify their parent expression. As a result, when using a cast
with a parallel expression, you must use a new instance of the parent
expression.
* Casting is not supported for `TablePerClass` inheritance.
* It is prudent to do a check for type in a query that does a cast.
* EclipseLink automatically appends type information for cases where the
cast results in a single type; but for classes in the middle of a
hierarchy, no type information is appended to the SQL.
