Clustering and Cache Coordination
---------------------------------

An application cluster is a set of middle tier server machines or VMs
servicing requests for a single application, or set of applications.
Multiple servers are used to increase the scalability of the application
and/or to provide fault tolerance and high availability. Typically the
same application will be deployed to all of the servers in the cluster
and application requests will be load balanced across the set of
servers. The application cluster will access a single database, or a
database cluster. An application cluster may allow new servers to be
added to increase scalability, and for servers to be removed such as for
updates and servicing.

Application clusters can consist of Jakarta EE servers, Web containers,
or Java server applications.

EclipseLink can function in any clustered environment. The main issue in
a clustered environment is utilizing a shared persistence unit (L2)
cache. If you are using a shared cache (enabled by default in
EclipseLink projects), then each server will maintain its own cache, and
each caches data can get out of synchronization with the other servers
and the database.

EclipseLink provides cache coordination in a clustered environment to
ensure the servers caches are synchronized.

There are also many other solutions to caching in a clustered
environment, including:

* Disable the shared cache (through setting `@Cacheable(false)`, or
`@Cache(isolation=ISOLATED`)).
* Use only cache read-only objects.
* Set a cache invalidation timeout to reduce stale data.
* Use refreshing on objects/queries when fresh data is required.
* Use optimistic locking to ensure write consistency (writes on stale
data will fail, and will automatically invalidate the cache).
* Use database events to invalidate changed data in the cache (such as
EclipseLink's support for Oracle Query Change Notification).

Cache coordination enables a set of persistence units deployed to
different servers in the cluster (or on the same server) to synchronize
their changes. Cache coordination works by each persistence unit on each
server in the cluster being able to broadcast notification of
transactional object changes to the other persistence units in the
cluster. EclipseLink supports cache coordination over RMI and JMS. The
cache coordination framework is also extensible so other options could
be developed.

By default, EclipseLink optimizes concurrency to minimize cache locking
during read or write operations. Use the default EclipseLink transaction
isolation configuration unless you have a very specific reason to change
it.

Cache coordination works by broadcasting changes for each transaction to
the other servers in the cluster. Each other server will receive the
change notification, and either invalidate the changed objects in their
cache, or update the cached objects state with the changes. Cache
coordination occurs after the database commit, so only committed changes
are broadcast.

Cache coordination greatly reduces to chance of an application getting
stale data, but does not eliminate the possibility. Optimistic locking
should still be used to ensure data integrity. Even in a single server
application stale data is still possible within a persistence context
unless pessimistic locking is used. Optimistic (or pessimistic) locking
is always required to ensure data integrity in any multi-user system.

For more information about cache coordination, including cache
synchronization, see "Using Cache Coordination" in _Solutions Guide for
EclipseLink_.

Coordinating JMS and RMI Caches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a JMS coordinated caches, when a particular session's coordinated
cache starts, it uses its JNDI naming service information to locate and
create a connection to the JMS server. The coordinated cache is ready
when all participating sessions are connected to the same topic on the
same JMS server. At this point, sessions can start sending and receiving
object change messages. You can then configure all sessions that are
participating in the same coordinated cache with the same JMS and JNDI
naming service information.

For an RMI coordinated cache, when a particular session's coordinated
cache starts, the session binds its connection in its naming service
(either an RMI registry or JNDI), creates an announcement message (that
includes its own naming service information), and broadcasts the
announcement to its multicast group. When a session that belongs to the
same multicast group receives this announcement, it uses the naming
service information in the announcement message to establish
bidirectional connections with the newly announced session's coordinated
cache. The coordinated cache is ready when all participating sessions
are interconnected in this way, at which point sessions can start
sending and receiving object change messages. You can then configure
each session with naming information that identifies the host on which
the session is deployed.

For more information on configuring JMS and RMI cache coordination, see
"Configuring JMS Cache Coordination Using Persistence Properties" and
"Configuring RMI Cache Coordination Using Persistence Properties" in
_Solutions Guide for EclipseLink_.

Coordinating Custom Caches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can define your own custom solutions for coordinated caches by using
the classes in the EclipseLink
`org.eclipse.persistence.sessions.coordination` package.
