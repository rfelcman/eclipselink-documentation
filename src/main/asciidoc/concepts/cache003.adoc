About Queries and the Cache
---------------------------

A query that is run against the shared persistence unit (session) cache
is known as an *in-memory query*. Careful configuration of in-memory
querying can improve performance.

By default, a query that looks for a single object based on primary key
attempts to retrieve the required object from the cache first, and
searches the data source only if the object is not in the cache. All
other query types search the database first, by default. You can specify
whether a given query runs against the in-memory cache, the database, or
both.

About Query Cache Options and In-memory Querying
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

JPA defines standard query hints for configuring how a query interacts
with the shared persistence unit cache (L2). EclipseLink also provides
some additional query hints for configuring the cache usage. For
information on JPA and EclipseLink query hints, see
link:queries006.htm#A7725420[About Query Hints.]

Entities can be accessed through JPA using either `find()` method or
queries. The `find()` method will first check the persistence context
cache (L1) for the Id, if the object is not found it will check the
shared persistence unit cache (L2), if the object is still not found it
will access the database. By default all queries will access the
database, unless querying by Id or by cache indexed fields. Once the
query retrieves the rows from the database, it will resolve each row
with the cache. If the object is already in the cache, then the row will
be discarded, and the object will be used. If the object is not in the
shared cache, then it will be built from the row and put into the shared
cache. A copy will also be put in the persistence context cache and
returned as the query result.

This is the general process, but it differs if the transaction is dirty.
If the transaction is dirty then the shared persistence unit cache will
be ignored and objects will be built directly into the persistence
context cache.

A transaction is considered dirty in the following circumstances:

* A `flush()` has written changes to the database.
* A pessimistic lock query has been executed.
* An update or delete query has been executed.
* A native SQL query has been executed.
* This persistence unit property `eclipselink.transaction.join-existing`
is used.
* The JDBC connection has been unwrapped from the EntityManager.
* The `UnitOfWork` API `beginEarlyTransaction` has been called.

Entities can also be configured to be isolated, or noncacheable, in
which case they will never be placed in the shared cache (see
link:cache001.htm#CDEEGICF["Shared, Isolated, Protected, Weak, and
Read-only Caches"]).
