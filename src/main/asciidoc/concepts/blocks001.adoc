About Metadata
--------------

The EclipseLink metadata is the bridge between the development of an
application and its deployed run-time environment. Capture the metadata
using the following:

* Annotations, and elements property extensions in the `persistence.xml`
file. The persistence provider interprets all these sources of metadata
to create an in-memory session and project at run time.
* Java and the EclipseLink API (this approach is the most
labor-intensive).

The metadata lets you pass configuration information into the run-time
environment. The run-time environment uses the information in
conjunction with the persistent classes (Java objects or entities) and
the code written with the EclipseLink API, to complete the application.

For more information, see "Overriding and Merging" in Jakarta
Persistence API (JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink.

[[BABDDBIJ]][[OTLCG91209]]

Advantages of the Metadata Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EclipseLink metadata architecture provides many important benefits,
including the following:

* Stores mapping information in XML—not in the domain model objects
* By using the metadata, EclipseLink does not intrude in the object
model or the database schema
* Allows you to design the object model as needed, without forcing any
specific design
* Allows DBAs to design the database as needed, without forcing any
specific design
* Does not rely on code-generation (which can cause serious design,
implementation, and maintenance issues)
* Is unobtrusive: adapts to the object model and database schema, rather
than requiring you to design their object model or database schema to
suit EclipseLink

Using EclipseLink JPA, you have the flexibility of expressing
persistence metadata using standard JPA annotations, deployment XML, or
both and you can optionally take advantage of EclipseLink JPA annotation
and `persistence.xml` property extensions.

[[BABEECEF]][[OTLCG91210]]

Creating Project Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A project contains the mapping metadata that the EclipseLink runtime
uses to map objects to a data source. The project is the primary object
used by the EclipseLink runtime.

This section describes the principal contents of project metadata,
including the following:

* link:#BABIECAI[Entity Mappings]
* link:#BABIEAJE[Data Source Login Information]

For Object-relational mapping, the EclipseLink runtime constructs an
in-memory project based on any combination of JPA annotations,
`persistence.xml`, and EclipseLink JPA annotations and `persistence.xml`
property extensions.

For MOXy mapping, the EclipseLink runtime uses a combination of JAXB
annotations and `eclipselink-oxm` bindings. See "Overriding and Merging"
in _Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_.

[[BABIECAI]][[OTLCG91211]]

Entity Mappings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

EclipseLink maps persistent entities to the database in the application.
There are several approaches to project development, including the
following:

* Importing classes and tables for mapping
* Importing classes and generating tables and mappings
* Importing tables and generating classes and mappings
* Creating both class and table definitions

The most common solution is to develop the persistent entities using a
development tool, such as a modeling tool or an integrated development
environment (IDE) like JDeveloper, and to develop the relational model
through appropriate relational design tools. You then use JDeveloper to
construct mappings that relate these two models.

Although JDeveloper offers the ability to generate persistent entities
or the relational model components for an application, these utilities
are intended only to assist in rapid initial development strategies—not
complete round-trip application development.

For more information, see link:descriptors.htm#CHECEAAE[Chapter 5,
"Understanding Descriptors"] and link:mappingintro.htm#CHDFEJIJ[Chapter
6, "Understanding Mappings"].

[[BABIEAJE]][[OTLCG91213]]

Data Source Login Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For POJO projects, you configure a session login in the session metadata
that specifies the information required to access the data source.

For more information, see link:#BABHHGDE[Creating Session Metadata.]

[[BABHHGDE]][[OTLCG91214]]

Creating Session Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A EclipseLink session contains the information required to access the
data source. The session is the primary object used by your application
to access the features of the EclipseLink runtime.

Using EclipseLink JPA, the EclipseLink runtime constructs an in-memory
session based on any combination of JPA and EclipseLink annotations, JPA
persistence properties (in the `persistence.xml` file), and EclipseLink
property extensions. See "Overriding and Merging" in _Jakarta
Persistence API (JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_.
